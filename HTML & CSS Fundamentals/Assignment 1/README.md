We are assigned to design a webpage for presenting the relationship of the Programme Learning Outcomes to HKU Educational Aims for an undergrad programme. The design should be a webpage with responsive design and appropriate styling. We can only use pure HTML & CSS to implement this webpage of the assignment.
