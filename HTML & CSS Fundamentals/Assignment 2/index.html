<h1>"She sights a Bird—she chuckles—"</h1>
<p>poem by Emily Dickinson<br>(around 1862)</p>
<p>
She sights a Bird—she chuckles—<br>
She flattens—then she crawls—<br>
She runs without the look of feet—<br>
Her eyes increase to Balls—</p>
<p>
Her Jaws stir—twitching—hungry—<br>
Her Teeth can hardly stand—<br>
She leaps, but Robin leaped the first—<br>
Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,</p>
<p>
The Hopes so juicy ripening—<br>
You almost bathed your Tongue—<br>
When Bliss disclosed a hundred Toes—<br>
And fled with every one—</p>
