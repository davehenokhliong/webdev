We are assigned to design and develop a Web app that retrieves and displays ‘real-time’ passenger flight information from Hong Kong Airport Open Data. This REST web service provided by HK Airport returns historical data (including current calendar day) in JSON format. For this assignment, we only display current calendar date departure and arrival passenger flight information. The Web app should be nicely rendered on any desktop computer and smart phone.

Objectives
1. To learn how to make use of Open Data (API).
2. To practice using JavaScript to (1) create dynamic contents, (2) carry out AJAX communication for
retrieving Open Data, and (3) selectively display flight information.
3. To practice using CSS styling to design a flexible and responsive layout.

We are going to make use of the data provided by the REST API of the Airport Authority for building our Web App.
